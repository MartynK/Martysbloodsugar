# Martysbloodsugar

Have some blood sugar data, trying to learn some lessons from it.

# Folder structure

Worthwhile output is in the 'Vignettes' folder compiled to html. Its a work in progress.

Data goes in the inst/extdata folder; should be read only; for xdrip, they're .zip-ped .csv-s

R/ has the "iterations" on the code in .r scripts.

# Notes
